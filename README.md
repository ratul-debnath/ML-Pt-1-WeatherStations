Objective

To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of
an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.



Context

For this Achievement, you’ll select your own data to analyze. You’ll first conduct an exploratory visual
analysis in Python before identifying connections between variables worth further exploration. Then,
after developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test them
before presenting your results in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard.
Data dashboards are an effective tool for presenting data in an accessible and tangible way. Your
dashboard will tell the story of your analytical journey and should contain a curation of the key results
you discovered throughout this Achievement. Not all of your results will fit into the dashboard—make
sure to include any additional analyses you conducted in a GitHub repository.
